# LLM-Model-for-Sales-Coaching
Introduction

This repository contains a Python project designed to leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) for enhancing sales coaching. The primary goal is to automate product feature descriptions and improve negotiation strategies based on customer interactions captured in sales call transcripts.
Project Overview

The project involves the following key components:

    Data Collection: Gathering sales call transcripts for training and testing.

    LLM Fine-Tuning: Adapting a pre-trained LLM to understand product features and customer interactions.

    Conversational Interface: Developing an interface where the LLM can engage with customers by asking questions and negotiating based on transcript analysis.

Requirements

    Python 3.9+: Ensure you have Python 3.9 or a later version installed.

    Transformers Library: Install the Transformers library using pip (pip install transformers).

    PyTorch: Install PyTorch for GPU acceleration if available (pip install torch torchvision).

    Google Colab or Local Environment: You can run this project in Google Colab or a local Python environment.

Installation

    Clone the repository:

bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/llm-sales-coaching.git

Install required packages:

    bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt

    Ensure you have a compatible GPU for faster training (optional).

Usage
Fine-Tuning the LLM

    Prepare your dataset by annotating transcripts with relevant labels.

    Modify the transcripts.py file to include your dataset paths and labels.

    Run the fine-tuning script:

    bash
    python fine_tune_llm.py

Generating Product Descriptions

    Use the fine-tuned model to generate product descriptions based on new transcripts:

    python
    from generate_description import generate_product_description

    transcript = "Discuss the new smartwatch features."
    description = generate_product_description(transcript)
    print(description)

Conversational Interface

    Implement a conversational interface using a framework like Flask or Django to interact with customers.

    Integrate the LLM with this interface to ask questions and negotiate based on customer input.
